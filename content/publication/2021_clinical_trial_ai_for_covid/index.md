abstract: "We previously developed a predictive model to help clinicians identify adults with COVID-19 who may be ready for discharge given their low risk of adverse events. This algorithm was integrated into our EHR to display regularly updated risk scores in patient lists and a summary report. Display of the score was pseudo-randomized to estimate effect on length of stay. The trial found no detectable difference in length of stay with no impact on safety indicators."
