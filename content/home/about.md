Vincent J. Major, PhD, is an Assistant Professor of Population Health at NYU Grossman School of Medicine who works closely with NYU Langone Health’s [Predictive Analytics Unit](https://nyupau.github.io/). Vincent’s work focuses on applied machine learning for healthcare and involves the development, validation, and deployment of predictive models using electronic health record (EHR) data.

Vincent received his PhD from New York University in 2020 for [his thesis work](https://search.proquest.com/openview/91689540c8c89b2e5e4c98285df096b1/) using EHR data to develop machine learning models to estimate risk of death within 60 days of hospitalization to encourage end-of-life planning. For his Master’s research, Vincent studied the respiratory dynamics of critical care patients supported by invasive mechanical ventilation using mathematical modeling and signal processing methods.
