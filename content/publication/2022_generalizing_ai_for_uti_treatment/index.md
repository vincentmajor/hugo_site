# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "An AI-based system for UTI antibiotic selection generalized fairly well to data from NYU Langone Health. However, utility in practice unclear due to a concerning trend of disparities against non-white patients. The tradeoff between inappropriate antibiotic treatment (IAT; how often the prescribed antiobiotic is ineffective) and broad-spectum usage (BSU; how often a stronger, more broad antibiotic is prescribed) is improved by the AI but white patients benefit significantly whereas non-white groups continue to receive ineffective and aggressive treatment."
