abstract = {Urinary tract infections (UTI) are a common indication for antibiotic treatment worldwide.
Fluoroquinolone antibiotics are widely prescribed for these infections, despite being
considered 'second-line' treatments. The use of these therapies contributes to increased
levels of antibiotic resistance. A recent paper [1] described a machine learning system
to recommend the narrowest antibiotic predicted to be appropriate for an individual's
UTI. Such data-driven techniques integrated with clinical decision support may play
a role in antibiotic stewardship and slow the onset of resistance.Decision making
algorithms may inadvertently contain bias that should be vetted before implementation.
Prior work has found unintended discriminatory practices in widely used healthcare
algorithms [2]. The UTI treatment system (and the data used to develop it) was investigated
for potential bias.},
